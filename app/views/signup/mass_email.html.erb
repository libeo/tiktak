Hepp!
-----
It's been a while since the last status email, as my old ISP was
blocked on just about all spam systems there are.

The server is now in a proper hosting environment, along with a
static IP and a great link, so we should be set for quite a while.
I've also installed a couple of brand new hard-drives, so your
data is even safer.

Notable changes
---------------
- New ISP with proper hosting
- Task Dependencies
- Recurring Tasks
- File drag and drop & Folders
- iCalendar feeds
- Email Reminders
- Integrated server/company/project-wide forums
- More auto-complete
- Task grouping / sorting
- User avatars

Account Information
