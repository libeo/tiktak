# Properties are used to describe tasks. Each property has a number of 
# PropertyValues which define the values available for the user to choose
# from.
#
# Properties can be created and edited by users in the system and so can 
# have any PropertyValues a user needs.

# Examples of potential properties include Priority, Status, Sub-project
# - anything that suits a company's workflow..
