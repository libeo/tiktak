== Welcome to ClockingIT

This is a developer preview, to try and get ClockingIT into releasable
shape.

I've only done rudimentary testing, so you'll most likely to run into
some problems. Feel free to let me know at admin@clockingit.com when
you do, and I'll try and help you get running. I have been able to run
this version on a pretty much clean install, so it should work.

ClockingIT is relased under the terms of the MIT License, see LICENSE
for more information.

== Getting started

For now, you'll have to do these steps manually, but there will be a
setup script or web page at a later stage.

1. sudo gem install tzinfo RedCloth rake ferret fastercsv\
   eventmachine rmagick icalendar mongrel

   Make sure you have ImageMagick installed.

2. mysql -u root -p
   create database cit;
   grant all on cit.* to cit@localhost identified by '<password>';
   flush privileges;

3. Copy config/*.yml-example to config/*.yml and modify as needed

4. mkdir index log store; chmod a+rwx log index store tmp/*
5. rake db:schema:load
6. Edit /etc/hosts on a machine with a web-browser and add:
   ip.to.clockingit.server www.clockingit.com
   ip.to.clockingit.server <subdomain>.clockingit.com

7. Start the different systems:
   sudo ./script/push_server
   sudo ./script/ferret_server -e production start
   ./lib/daemons/mail_sender.rb (if you want daily reminder emails)
   ./script/server -e production
   Create the initial account at http://www.clockingit.com:3000/login/signup

8.Sign in from http://<subdomain>.clockingit.com:3000/

== Example for Apache conf

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName *.clockingit.com
    DocumentRoot /path/application/public/
    ErrorLog /path/application/log/server.log

    <Directory /path/application/public/>
      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride all
      Allow from all
      Order allow,deny
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

== Example for Apache using mod_rewrite

This will redirect requests for http://server.my_domain.com to https://server.my_domain.com
and will proxy requests for https://server.my_domain.com to http://hostname.clockingit.com:3000 on the localhost
The end-user who is contacting server.my_domain.com does not know that the request is being proxied, because apache will change the "Host:" values to itself as it sends back the response. The proxy request is performed on the localhost, which is informed by /etc/hosts that hostname.clockingit.com points to 127.0.0.1

### Insecure VirtualHost ###

ServerAdmin root@my_domain.com
ServerName server.my_domain.com
UseCanonicalName Off
# Force clients from the Internet to use HTTPS

RewriteRule ^/?(.*)$ https://server.my_domain.com/$1 [L,R]
</VirtualHost>

### SSL VirtualHost ###
<VirtualHost *:443>
ServerAdmin root@my_domain.com
ServerName server.my_domain.com
UseCanonicalName Off
SSLCertificateFile /home/clockingit/ssl.cert.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile /home/clockingit/ssl.key.pem

ProxyRequests Off
<Proxy *>
Order Allow,Deny
Allow from all
</Proxy>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://hostname.clockingit.com:3000/$1 [P,NC]
ProxyPassReverse / http://hostname.clockingit.com:3000/
</VirtualHost>
